# GUALTI_BDM_macros

This is a series of hotkeys to use with Ellucian's BANNER ERP software, paricularly the GUIALTI module, well as AppXtender. 

A large part of my job is ID'ing transcripts and I use GUIALTI extensively for that process. Using a screen resolution of 1920x1080, and either Chrome or Edge as the browser, these macros will:

1. Within GUIALTI, clear Last Name, First Name fields and set the cursor in the Last Name field, ready for a new entry. (alt + v)
2. Within AppXtender, after supplying an ID, fill in document type, term code, and commit to a student's index. (note: term code needs to be manually adjust per term changeover) Currently indexes for High School (ctrl + q), College (ctrl + w), Recommendation (alt + c), Test (ctrl + t), Proof of Citizenship (alt + p). Resets document index with (ctrl + r).
